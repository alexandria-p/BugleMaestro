## Description

Play the bugle üìØ using your keyboard keys. Multiplayer-friendly! Access three octaves & all the semitones inbetween.

## Intructions

You no longer need to click your mouse to blow the Bugle. Instead, tap your Z ---> M keys on your keyboard.

SCALE:
*CDEFGAB* notes are represented on your typical QWERTY keyboard as Z ---> M

OCTAVES:
You can go up or down octaves by holding the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW keys, respectively.

SEMITONES:
You can sharpen or flatten notes by holding the RIGHT ARROW or LEFT ARROW keys, respectively.

Currently keyboard-only (no controller support).

Because this mod uses the arrow keys, I've disabled their typical use for walking. You'll need to run around in-game used WASD instead.

### Are there any other ways I can play the Bugle? What about mod compatibility?

Absolutely! If you'd like to play the bugle like a real chambered brass instrument, please checkout *Virtuoso* (https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/mondash/Virtuoso/) by Matthew Ondash/mondash.

Unfortunately in-game, you can only choose one way to play your Bugle at a time.
Make sure all players either enable *Bugle Maestro* or *Virtuoso* for their players. Whichever mod you decide not to use, ensure all players have it disabled.

This mod should work with *Pocket Bugle* (https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/mondash/PocketBugle/) also by Matthew Ondash/mondash. You may want to remap the bind key used by *Pocket Bugle* for summoning the Bugle in-game, to make sure it does not clash with this mod's controls.


### Changelog
